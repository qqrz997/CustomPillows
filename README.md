A Beat Saber mod that shouldn't exist (but yet it does). This mod is maintained here. Credit to the original contributors and ToniMacaroni the original author.

## Manual Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to BSIPA, you must have [SiraUtil](https://github.com/Auros/SiraUtil) and [BeatSaberMarkupLanguage](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage) installed for this mod to load. Install them using your mod manager.

### For Beat Saber v1.37.1

Place the contents of the unzipped folder from the latest [release](https://github.com/qqrz997/CustomPillows/releases/latest) into your Beat Saber installation folder. If you need more information regarding manual installation of mods [this wiki page](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#manual-installation) will help. For further help with installing mods, join the [Beat Saber Modding Group](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) discord server.

Older versions of the mod for older versions of the game are not supported. If you find issues using an older version then I won't be able to help.

## Usage
In-game you will see a mod panel on the left hand side which should include a "Custom Pillows" button.
Click it to go into the mod settings.

1) Select an image in the left list and click the arrow pointing to the right to use it on your pillows
2) Do that for any image you would like to add
3) On the right panel select an "constellation" to change the arrangement of the pillows
4) If you are unhappy with how the textures are layed out click the "Shuffle" button on the bottom in the middle panel

## How to add your own images

1) In the "UserData/CustomPillows/Images" folder you will find a "template.png". Load that up in your favorite image editing software
2) Edit your image so that your character roughly fits in the white area
3) Save it as an **png in the same folder as the template**
